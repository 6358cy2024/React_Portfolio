# React_Portfolio

The purpose of this assignment is to create an updated portfolio using react to show off how much we have learned over the course of this bootcamp.

I will create a webpage that has all of my previous works and a contact page that uses web 3 forms to allow messages to be sent to my email address.
The About page will give a general outline of what my page will display to users and newcomers.

This page will have a way to view my githib at the footer of the page.
